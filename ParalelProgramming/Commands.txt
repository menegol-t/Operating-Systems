Make your program in C using #include <mpi.h>
Compile with: $ mpicc helloWorld.c -o helloWorld

To run the code as is execute with: $ srun --mpi=pmix -n [number of processing units] ./helloWorld

Otherwise, you should make a bash script that runs the code. For that make a helloWorld-mpi.sh:
"#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --nodes=4			//Number of nodes
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=4		//Number of process per node
#SBATCH --output=mpi-out.%j		//This will make a file named mpi-out.[PID] with the output in case of success
#SBATCH --error=mpi.err.%j		//This will make a file with logs in case of error, called mpi.err.[PID]
#SBATCH --time=00:00:00			//Delay the execution of the job: 0.
#SBATCH --partition=cronos		

cd $SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR
mpirun helloWorld"			//Program to run

Then run with: $ sbatch ./helloWorld.sh

More slurm commands:
$ sinfo 		//Cluster and nodes state
$ squeue 		//Queued jobs
